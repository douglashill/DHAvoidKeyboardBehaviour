# DHAvoidKeyboardBehaviour

A [behaviour][objc] for iOS apps to ensure scroll view content is not covered by the keyboard.

[objc]: http://www.objc.io/issue-13/behaviors.html 

## Status

Seems to work, but not thoroughly tested or in production. The animations can look rough when dismissing the keyboard interactively.

## Usage

Create a `DHAvoidKeyboardBehaviour` and set its `scrollView` to the scroll view that should avoid the keyboard. Keep the behaviour object alive.
